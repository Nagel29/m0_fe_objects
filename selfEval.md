# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - _Not sure I would say I struggled, but it took me a minute to get the differences in how to print an object, print an object's values, print an object's keys, and print one particular value/key._
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - _My note-taking is going well. What I find most helpful is having examples in my notes with labels identifying the different parts of the example. For example, an Object with notes showing which part the object name is, which part the key is, which part the value is. I probably take the most helpful notes when I'm not feeling rushed._
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - _Usually I play around with the code first in Replit to try to understand it. If I'm not fully getting it then I go to Google. If the exercise is asking me to do something that is completely new, then I just go straight to Google typically._
